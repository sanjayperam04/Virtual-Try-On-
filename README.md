# Virtual-Try-On-Retail-Solution
Virtual try-ons powered by technologies like OpenCV, Haar-Cascades, and NumPy are revolutionizing retail. Combined with Python-based dynamic pricing, they enable real-time adjustments and personalized shopping experiences through AI-driven color recommendations, optimizing inventory and competitive positioning.

## Dynamic Pricing System
- **File:** `dynamic_pricing.py`
- Simulates a simple dynamic pricing system for products with adjustable prices based on demand levels and competitor prices.
- Users can interact by choosing a product to "buy" or exit the program.

**Example Usage:**
```
python dynamic_pricing.py
```
## Virtual Dressing Room
- File: virtual_dressing_room.py
- Utilizes computer vision to overlay a virtual dress on the upper body in a live webcam feed.
- Requires OpenCV for face and upper body detection, and supports PNG images with an alpha channel for transparency.
### Example Usage:
```
python virtual_dressing_room.py
```
## Instructions for Running the Scripts
### Dynamic Pricing System
- Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
- Install the required libraries using:
```
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```
- Run the script:
```
python dynamic_pricing.py
```
### Virtual Dressing Room
- Install the required libraries using:
```
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib imageio
```
- Adjust the dress image path in the script to match your system.
Run the script:
```
python virtual_dressing_room.py
```
## Additional Notes
### Dynamic Pricing System:
- Products are represented by the Product class, and the dynamic pricing system is managed by the DynamicPricingSystem class.
Adjustments to product prices are based on demand levels, competitor prices, and user interactions.

### Virtual Dressing Room:
- Requires a webcam for live video feed.
- The dress image should have an alpha channel for transparency, allowing realistic overlay on the upper body.
- OpenCV is used for face and upper body detection.
- Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance these scripts for your projects or use cases. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please let me know at rupinajay@gmail.com.
